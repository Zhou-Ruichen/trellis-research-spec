# Data Guidelines

Use these rules whenever reading, writing, validating, or transforming data.

The project may keep data under `data/`. The rule is not "no data in repo"; the
rule is "data must have lifecycle, provenance, and rebuild instructions."

## Documentation Files

| File | Read when |
| --- | --- |
| [../shared/project-layout.md](../shared/project-layout.md) | Naming data paths |
| [../shared/reproducibility.md](../shared/reproducibility.md) | Writing manifests and run records |
| [../shared/anti-bloat.md](../shared/anti-bloat.md) | Adding processing scripts or variants |

## Data Layout

```text
data/
  raw/
  external/
  interim/
  processed/
  manifests/
```

Use `data/raw/` for immutable local raw inputs or symlinks. Use
`data/external/` for read-only external data roots or symlink targets. Use
`data/interim/` for temporary but rebuildable products. Use `data/processed/`
for durable processed products.

Existing projects may use different names. Map these lifecycle concepts onto
the existing structure instead of renaming directories without a migration
task.

## Source Rule

External or shared data sources are read-only by default. Project code writes
to project-local `data/interim/`, `data/processed/`, or `outputs/<run_id>/`.
Writing back into a shared source requires an explicit data-processing task and
a manifest.

## Manifest Rule

Every durable data product needs a manifest in `data/manifests/`.

Required fields:

```json
{
  "name": "processed_dataset_v1",
  "created_at": "2026-06-10T14:22:33Z",
  "created_by": "python scripts/build_dataset.py --config configs/data.yaml",
  "source_paths": [],
  "source_versions": {},
  "processing_config": "configs/data.yaml",
  "output_paths": [],
  "checksums": {},
  "schema": null,
  "split_policy": null,
  "assumptions": []
}
```

Do not invent unavailable fields. Use `null`, an empty list, or a clear
assumption only when the value is truly unknown.

## Boundary Validation

Validate at the point where data enters the project:

- file exists and format is expected;
- schema, columns, variables, or record layout are known;
- units and coordinate conventions are explicit when relevant;
- shapes, dimensions, and dtypes match expectations;
- missing values, NaN, fill values, or sentinel values are handled explicitly;
- train/validation/test splits cannot leak entities, time ranges, regions,
  subjects, or source records when leakage matters.

## Data Processing Entrypoints

Use one stable entrypoint per durable processing stage:

```text
scripts/build_dataset.py
scripts/validate_dataset.py
scripts/export_product.py
```

Do not create:

```text
scripts/build_dataset_v2.py
scripts/build_dataset_final.py
scripts/1_make_data.py
scripts/2_fix_data.py
```

If the stage changes, update parameters and manifest, not the script name.

## Quality Check

- [ ] Durable data output has a manifest.
- [ ] Splits or comparison groups are recorded and leakage-checked when
      relevant.
- [ ] Data paths are parameterized or documented, not hardcoded workstation
      paths.
- [ ] Missing values, units, schema, and conventions are explicit.
- [ ] Large generated data is ignored by git unless the user explicitly
      chooses to version a small fixture.
